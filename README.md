# to_do-list
Dynamic To-Do List
A clean and responsive to-do list application built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript. This project allows users to dynamically add tasks with an optional timestamp and remove them from the list. The interface features a modern "liquid glass" style for a visually appealing user experience.

Features
Add Tasks: Users can add new tasks to the list via an input field.

Optional Timestamps: An optional datetime-local input allows users to add a specific due date and time to each task.

Delete Tasks: Each task has a "Done" button that, when clicked, removes the specific task from the list.

Dynamic UI: New tasks are added to the page instantly without a refresh.

Responsive Design: The layout is fully responsive and works well on both desktop and mobile devices.

Modern Styling: The project features a "liquid glass" (glassmorphism) effect with a blurred, transparent background and clean UI elements.

Efficient Event Handling: Uses event delegation to efficiently manage delete events for all tasks with a single event listener.

Technologies Used
This project was built using foundational web technologies:

HTML5: For the semantic structure of the application.

CSS3: For all styling, including the liquid glass effect, layout (using Flexbox), and responsiveness.

Vanilla JavaScript: For all the logic, including DOM manipulation, creating and deleting elements, and event handling.

How to Use
Simply open the index.html file in any modern web browser to start using the to-do list.
